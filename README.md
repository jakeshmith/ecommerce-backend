# E-Commerce Backend Project
by Jake Smith

## Project Description

In this application, I designed the entirety of a project's back end for an application designed to keep track of the different kinds of products supplied by an ecommerce website.
I created Models for the data, as well as api routes featuring Get, Put, Post, and Delete calls in order to get information from a server. This project utilizes Expressjs,
dotenv, mysql, and Insomnia to test routes. ORM was the goal in this one.
